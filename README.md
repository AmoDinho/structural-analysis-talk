Notes for a talk on structural analysis

When embarking on making apps as an engineer sometimes a mock up in high fidelity form is not enough to properly translate what the business needs into code. structural analysis or modeling allows you describe things within your app as objects and how those objects are related each other and what they are meant to do. This is usually done through object-oriented or UML concepts.

How can it make me better? 

You know exactly what you need to code and what to test within your code. Start archtirual planning early and know what behaviours are needed from your users.
